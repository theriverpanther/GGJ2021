# TODO LIST

## Minimum Viable Product
- Physics for the key (collision detection with objects, bouncing off of things, etc)
- Controls for the key (jumping, moving camera)
- Camera tracking
- Spawn point, exit, and rooms inbetween to traverse

## Extras
- Double jump
- Elastic object collisions (i.e. knocking things over)
- Puzzle mechanics (have to jump up to land on a button that opens the door, etc)
- Picking up other objects along the way to the exit.
- Sound effects (maybe some voice lines from the locked in/out owner being frustrated lol)
- Roomba
