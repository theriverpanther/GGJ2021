# TODO LIST

## Minimum Viable Product
- ~~Physics for the key (collision detection with objects, bouncing off of things, etc)~~
- ~~Controls for the key (jumping, moving camera)~~
- Camera tracking \[Almost done]
- Spawn point, exit, and rooms inbetween to traverse \[Level design in progress]
- ~~Basic UI and instructions~~
- ~~Title splash~~

## Extras
- ~~Elastic object collisions (i.e. knocking things over)~~
- Puzzle mechanics (have to jump up to land on a button that opens the door, etc) \[tools for this have been created but aren't finished]
- Picking up other objects along the way to the exit.
- Sound effects (maybe some voice lines from the locked in/out owner being frustrated lol) \[Key clanking done. Might want to add jump sound and ambient noise/music]
- Roomba \[In progress]
